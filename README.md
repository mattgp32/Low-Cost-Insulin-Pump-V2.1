# Ultra Low-Cost Insulin Pump

This Git repository represents the final result of multiple design iterations of a low-cost insulin pump I have designed as part of my studies in medical device development. The repository contains files for hardware, both electrical and mechanical, and firmware. I have also included a BOM to make ordering of components easier if anyone wishes to replicate this design. The device has been tested in humans, in a small clinical trial, and a write-up of the results was published [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11292867/).

## Overview

The files for this device are split into four main areas: electrical hardware, mechanical hardware, android application, and firmware. This README contains a subsection for each of these aspects, including build instructions, initial setup, and usage. A complete exploded assembly for the device is shown in the image below:
